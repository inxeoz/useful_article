# 🐳 Managing Docker Containers Like a Pro

### A Complete Guide to Persistence, Commits, and Container Lifecycle

Docker is one of the most powerful tools for creating isolated, reproducible environments.
But to truly use it effectively, you need to understand how to manage containers — how to keep your changes, store data, map ports, and reuse your configurations efficiently.

This guide walks you through **real-world container management**, step by step.

---

## ⚙️ 1. What is a Docker Container?

A **container** is a running instance of a **Docker image** — a lightweight, isolated environment that can hold your software, tools, and files.

* **Image** = the blueprint (a frozen snapshot, like an OS or preconfigured setup)
* **Container** = the living instance of that image

When you stop or delete a container, your data and changes can vanish — unless you know how to make them persistent.

---

## 📦 2. Creating and Running a Container

To start a container interactively:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu:22.04 bash
```

Here’s what each flag does:

* `-i` → Interactive mode (keeps STDIN open)
* `-t` → Allocates a pseudo-TTY (makes it feel like a real terminal)
* `ubuntu:22.04` → The image to base the container on
* `bash` → The command to run inside (the shell)

You’ll now be inside the container’s terminal (`root@containerID:/#`).

---

## 🔄 3. Creating a Named Container (for Persistence)

If you don’t name your container, Docker gives it a random name.
You can assign your own with `--name` so you can reopen it later.

```bash
docker run -it --name myubuntu ubuntu:22.04 bash
```

Exit when you’re done:

```bash
exit
```

Later, restart it and reattach with:

```bash
docker start -ai myubuntu
```

✅ All files and installed packages will still be there.

---

## 💾 4. Making Data Persistent (Volumes)

By default, container files live *inside* the container — so if it’s removed, data is gone.
You can **mount a directory from your host** to the container using `-v`.

Example:

```bash
docker run -it -v ~/mydata:/root/data ubuntu:22.04 bash
```

* `~/mydata` → folder on your host
* `/root/data` → folder inside the container

Now, anything you save in `/root/data` is stored *on your host system* — even if the container is deleted.

---

## 🌐 5. Mapping Ports (Accessing Apps from Host)

If your container runs a web server or service (like mdserve, Flask, etc.), you’ll need to map its ports to the host system.

Use `-p` to map ports:

```bash
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 ubuntu:22.04 bash
```

* `8000:8000` → host_port:container_port
  So if your app listens on port 8000 inside, you can visit it on your host at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## 🧱 6. Saving Changes (Committing a Container)

When you customize a container (install software, edit configs, etc.), you can **commit** it to save the state as a new image.

```bash
docker commit myubuntu myubuntu:custom
```

Now you can start new containers from your saved configuration:

```bash
docker run -it --name myclone myubuntu:custom bash
```

This creates a new container with all your changes already baked in — like a snapshot.

---

## 🕹️ 7. Running a Specific Commit

Each commit you make creates a **new image layer**, identified by an **image ID** or tag.

To list your images:

```bash
docker images
```

Output:

```
REPOSITORY       TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
myubuntu         custom     e21a34bfb3a4   2 minutes ago    480MB
```

To run a specific version by ID or tag:

```bash
docker run -it e21a34bfb3a4 bash
# or
docker run -it myubuntu:custom bash
```

---

## 🧹 8. Removing Containers and Images

Over time, you may accumulate old containers or images.
Here’s how to clean up safely.

### Remove a single container:

```bash
docker rm myubuntu
```

### Remove all stopped containers:

```bash
docker container prune
```

### Remove an image:

```bash
docker rmi myubuntu:custom
```

### Remove all unused data (CAUTION):

```bash
docker system prune -a
```

---

## 🧩 9. Running a Container Again by Name

If you used `--name`, you can easily restart your container later.

Example:

```bash
docker start -ai myubuntu
```

That’s shorthand for:

* `start` → start the container
* `-a` → attach to it (see output)
* `-i` → interactive (so you can type commands)

✅ You’ll be dropped back into your previous environment instantly.

| Clean all stopped containers | `docker container prune`                 | Free space safely                    |
| Clean all unused images      | `docker image prune -a`                  | Remove unused images                 |

## 🧠 Bonus Tips

* Use `--rm` **only for temporary** testing containers (it auto-deletes after exit).
* Always **commit** after large configuration changes.
* Combine volumes (`-v`) and ports (`-p`) for realistic app testing.
* Use descriptive names (`--name devserver`, `--name docs`, etc.) to stay organized.

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Docker containers are incredibly powerful when managed properly.
By understanding how to:

* name and persist containers
* mount volumes
* map ports
* commit and reuse your configurations

You can turn Docker into a flexible, reproducible environment for development, testing, and deployment — all while keeping your host system clean.
